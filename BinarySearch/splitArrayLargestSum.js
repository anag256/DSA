//minimum no of partititons we can make is 1
// maximum no of partitions for n that can be is n
// [3,4,1,2]=> [3] [4] [1] [2]

// case i=if max no of partitions is 1 then sum = sum of array
// case ii-  maximum no of partitions for n that can be is n
// // [3,4,1,2]=> [3] [4] [1] [2]
// ans in this case is max value of array 4
